## How-to

### Initial configuration

1. Create an empty folder with a file named `iglooconfig.txt` inside it with the
   following content:
```
{
    "url" : "<Instance URL>",
    "username" : "<Instance username>",
    "password" : "<Instance password>",
    "app_name" : "<Name of you application>",
    "track_changes": true
}
```
2. Open the folder in VSCode and wait unitil statusbar displays the message
   `IglooReloaded: Active`.
3. Press `Ctrl + Alt + a` to fetch all scripts from ServiceNow.

### Autocompletions

Autocompletions should be working out of the box (use `Ctrl + Space` to trigger
them). If you're not able to see autocompletions, make sure you have not deleted
the `@types` directory or the `jsconfig.json` file.

If some autocompletions are incorrect (they are autogenerated from the
ServiceNow docs), you can
[create an issue](https://github.com/GelaniNijraj/IglooReloaded/issues).

### Adding new tables to import from

If you think that scripts from some tables should be imported by default you can
[create an issue](https://github.com/GelaniNijraj/IglooReloaded/issues).

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command pallet and select the
   "IglooReloaded: Create default mappings.json file"
2. A new mappings.json file will be created in your workspace.
3. Edit this file to add or remove new tables.

### Enabling/Disabling local git version tracking

Change the value of key `track_changes` to either `true` or `false` to enable or
disable local version tracking.
